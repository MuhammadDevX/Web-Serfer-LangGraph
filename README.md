# Web Surfer - AI-Powered Web Assistant

A Streamlit-based web application that provides an AI-powered assistant capable of browsing the web, extracting information, running Python code, and more.

## Features

- üåê Web browsing and navigation
- üìÑ Information extraction from websites
- üêç Python code execution
- üíæ File management capabilities
- ü§ñ AI-powered task completion
- üìä Real-time feedback and evaluation

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install Playwright browsers:**
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   The application will automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

3. **Start using Web Surfer:**
   - Enter your request in the text area
   - Specify your success criteria
   - Click "Go!" to process your request
   - Use the reset button to start fresh

## How it Works

The Web Surfer uses:
- **LangGraph** for workflow orchestration
- **Playwright** for web automation
- **OpenAI GPT-4** for AI processing
- **Streamlit** for the user interface

The system follows a workflow where:
1. Your request is processed by an AI worker
2. The worker uses various tools (web browsing, Python execution, etc.)
3. An evaluator checks if the success criteria are met
4. The process continues until completion or user input is needed

## File Structure
